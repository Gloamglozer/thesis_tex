\section{Full-Wave Models for Passive Components and Antennas}
\label{sec:org0788e1b}
  As RF designs move to higher frequencies and designs become smaller,
designers are increasingly moving to full-wave simulators such as
ANSYS HFSS in order simulate their designs. Both planar and full-wave
electromagnetic simulations are popular among those designing
distributed microwave networks [cite], but as of today, full-wave
simulation for lumped passive components is yet to be widely adopted.
Full-wave simulations have been used historically to inform circuit models
as in \cite{6f867bceb88343ec822a0e4fdd6d6d63}, but the roadblocks of computing power and protection of intellectual property kept them from being widely adopted for design work. 

%https://www.ansys.com/-/media/ansys/corporate/resourcelibrary/techbrief/ab-ansys-hfss-3d-data-sheet.pdf
Recently, however, the release of HFSS R16 introduced a system which allows an HFSS design to be modularized into a "3-D Component", encapsulating a sub-design's geometry and material information, meshing operations, and variables. 
Furthermore, with version R17 came the ability to encrypt these parts, which allows 3-D components to simulate accurately while hiding their internal geometry and material properties from the user.  \cite{HFSS_3d_components}
With this development, manufacturers and modeling services now have a viable way to distribute  full-wave component models without revealing the intellectual property of the manufacturers.  

Given this, companies Johanson Technology, Inc. and Modelithics, Inc. have been released full-wave models of commercially available electrical components intended for direct use by the designer.  
With versions of HFSS 18.3 or later, a component palette of various Johanson chip antennas is included which the designer may drop into their design in order to evaluate the gain, efficiency and match of an antenna design entirely with simulation.  
Modelithics offers an initial sampling of packages, inductors and capacitors that would allow the designer to predict the effects of unusual configurations or interaction between components on any microwave design, as demonstrated in \cite{mdlx_3d_models}. 
Though the effects of interactions can be a second thought to many microwave designers, they can can have a very significant effect on the response of compact filters, matching networks and other designs involving passives.  
Below, Figure 7 and 8 of \cite{mdlx_3d_models} are shown, in which the measured response of 3 closely-spaced 1.6nH coilcraft 0603CS inductors is compared both to a circuit simulation using Modelithics' equivalent circuit model of the part, as well as the newly made HFSS model of the same.

At the closest spacing, the circuit model predicts the self resonance of the part to be about 2 GHz less than it actually occurs, whereas the 3-D component model is less than 500 MHz off.  
The ability to trust your models in such extreme configurations as these allows the microwave designer to attain the maximum performance of their parts, and precludes costly and time consuming revisions.  

Though there are many cases where properly made circuit models are more appropriate than 3-D models \cite{ltcc_filter}, there are cases in high-performance designs where the accuracy of 3-D models.  
The two most common of these being predicting interactions between components, and predicting performance in unusual part configurations. 

\subsection{Predicting Inter-Component Coupling}
\label{sec:orgb79655d}

\subsection{Versitility in Unusual Configurations}
\label{sec:orge05ecd7}
    Another limitation of equivalent circuit models is the fact that
they are usually developed on a specific medium (such as microstrip,
GCPW, etc.), and that the values of the parasitics in a component's
equivalent circuit model are dependent on the the medium it was
developed in. Grounded Co-planar Waveguide has seen an increase in use for
applications in the tens of GHz given the fact that it operates
quasi-TEM up to higher frequencies than microstrip as shown in Figure
2 of ~\cite{coonrod2012comparing}. A geometric model used in conjunction
with a full-wave electromagnetics simulator can give the engineer
confidence that the component will act as predicted independent of medium.

   Similarly, researchers in the field of antenna design have also
encountered the fact that a capacitor may not perform at the nominal
capacitance if it is not in a traditional microstrip configuration. In
~\cite{mumcuCapacitors}, Figure 5b and 3b, measured data shows a 50 MHz shift
downward in frequency which is in part attributable to the fact that
an ideal, nominally-valued capacitor was used, with no modeling of the
real component's interaction with the surrounding environment.

\subsubsection{Full-Wave v.s. Equivalent Circuit Model Simulation
Example:}


 The parasitic which has a value most sensitive to medium is the
termination to ground capacitance, as is demonstrated by the circuit
and full wave simulations below.

 Pictured below are two full-wave models of a 1 pF Johanson R05L
capacitor, one mounted on a \(50 \Omega\) microstrip transmission line,
[substrate dims here], the other mounted on a \(50 \Omega\) GCPW line.
Both transmission lines are simulated on 30 mil Rogers 4350B, and use
wave ports The E field vector at f = 3 GHz is plotted for each of the
capacitors at the plane midway through their terminations. Wave ports
were used at both ends of both simulated test fixtures, Notice the fact that more of the E field lies within the
dielectric material of the substrate for co-planar waveguide as it has
two ground planes directly adjacent to the termination of the device.

[picture of e field for gcpw and microstrip]

\(S_{21}\) of both capacitors for f = 1 to 5 GHz is plotted below. 

  We can now fit the response of these capacitors to a Modelithics
equvalent circuit model in the "simplified parasitic model" mode,
along with termination-to-ground capacitance on each termination, as
well as termination-to-termination capacitance. 
the "simplified parasitic model" mode is a mode in which all of the parasitic effects associated with
the terminations of the device are removed, leaving behind effects
relegated to the "inside" of the component, such as effective series
resisitance, effective capacitance, and effective series inductance.



\section{An Investigation into Inter-Component Coupling}
\label{sec:org9345255}
 Inter-component coupling is present to some degree in circuits at all
frequencies, and is widely understood in a conceptual sense. This kind
of coupling is the added response caused by putting two or more
components together, that would not be present when the components are
on their own. Physically, this corresponds to the mutual capacitance
or inductance between the outer parts of two components.

    It is intuitive that these effects are more pronounced when
components are closer together, but the effect of other factors such
as the board height, relative rotation of components, and whether the
interconnects are microstrip or GCPW, has not been systematically
studied in the literature. A factorial ANOVA based experiment is
detailed below.

\subsection{A Rigourous Definition of Inter-Component Coupling}
\label{sec:org0d893c1}
   If coupling is to be studied in an experiment, we must first have a
measurement-based mathematical formulation of coupling. The following
section shows the metric coupling will be measured in this study.
\subsubsection{Wave Cascade Matrices}
\label{sec:org2b8ea1d}
    All microwave engineers familiar with S parameters, which are
commonly collected into a matrix in the case of two-port networks. The
S matrix relates the incident (or \(a\)) waves to the reflected (or \(b\))
waves like so:
\begin{gather}
 \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{bmatrix}
 =
  \bar S 
  \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2  \end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

    Less widely used, but very convenient for finding the response of
two-port microwave networks is the wave cascade matrix corresponding
to an arbitrary two port, \(\bar W\) ,which relates the incident and
reflected waves like so:

\begin{gather}
 \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ a_1 \end{bmatrix}
 =
  \bar W 
  \begin{bmatrix} a_2 \\ b_2  \end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

   From this we see that the wave cascade matrix of two two-port
networks cascaded is \(\bar W_1 \bar W_2\) , where \(\bar W_1 ,\bar W_2\)
are the wave cascade matrices of arbitrary two ports 1 and 2.

\subsubsection{Coupling Metric}
\label{sec:orgc05ec0c}
Consider a design composed of \(k\) two-port networks in series as shown
below:

  If \(i\) is the variable which indexes these cascaded two-port
networks, we define that the \(i^{th}\) two-port has wave cascade matrix
\(\bar W_i\), and the wave cascade matrix of the entire section is \(\bar
W_{tot}\). Both \(\bar W_i\) and \(\bar W_{tot}\) will have to be directly
measured in order to find coupling by this metric. Since the
measurement of \(\bar W_{tot}\) will have all of the sub-designs
directly cascaded, there will be some amount of coupling between the
components. So, we can define coupling of a specific ordered set of
two-port designs to be:

$$Coupling = \sum_{elements} ( \bar W_{tot} - \prod_{i=1}^k \bar W_i
)$$

\section{Design of 7-Element Quadrature Coupler}
\label{sec:org87715f0}
  A principal component of many microwave designs is the coupler. As
the allotment of physical space for microwave designs decreases,
distributed implementations of quadrature couplers become less
attractive to the designer. However, for some designs, the use of a
MMIC process to provide the best miniaturization is unavailable. This
leaves the discrete component lumped-element quadrature coupler as a
good solution for designs which are to be produced in small quantity,
with relatively quick and inexpensive design iterations. A similar
coupler to the one proposed is shown in [dunleavy+ashok white paper],
which demonstrates the concept in a microstrip implementation. In the
interest of making the smallest design possible, this coupler will be
implemented using the Grounded Coplanar Waveguide (GCPW) medium, and
using 0402 package size components. The topology of the coupler is
shown below:

\begin{center}
  \begin{circuitikz}
  \draw
  (0,0) to [short,o-*] (2,0) to [L,l_=$L$] (7,0) to[short,*-o] (9,0)
  (2,0) to[C,l_=$C$] (2,3) (7,0) to [C,l_=$C$] (7,3)
  (2,3) to[L,l_=$L$] (7,3)
  (2,3) to[C,l_=$C$] (2,6) (7,3) to [C,l_=$C$] (7,6)
  (0,6) to [short,o-*] (2,6) to [L,l_=$L$] (7,6) to[short,*-o] (9,6)
  ; 
  \end{circuitikz}
\end{center}

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{sec:org07519ea}
   As shown in [3], the topology of this coupler can be understood
with an even and odd mode analysis, in which the values of inductance
and capacitance in the coupler are taken to be

$$ L = \frac{Z_0}{\omega}, \qquad \qquad C = \frac1{Z_0 \omega} $$

Given our design frequency of 2.45 GHz, and a system \(Z_0\) of 50
\(\Omega\), we find that the necessary L and C needed for our coupler
is:

$$ L = \frac{50}{2\pi\cdot2.45E9} = \boxed{3.248E-9}, \qquad \qquad C
= \frac1{50\cdot2\pi\cdot2.45E9} = \boxed{1.299E-12}$$

\section{Phase Shifter Design}
\label{sec:orge04b59d}
  Another ubiquitious and simple passive microwave building block is
the phase shifter. One realization of a compact, lumped element phase
shifter is a low-pass-equivalent tee network, consisting of two series
capacitors and one shunt inductor, was manufactured and simulated.
\subsection{Design:}
\label{sec:orgde829bd}
   A 4-port Butler matrix employs two 45 degree phase shifters in
order to provide the correct progressive phase shift through the four
elements. The aformentioned network is shown below:

\#+CAPTION 3 element tee phase shifter topology
\begin{center}
  \begin{circuitikz}
  \draw
  (0,3) to [short,-o] (0,3)
  (0,3) to [C,l_=$C$] (3,3)

  (3,1) to [short] node[ground] {} (3,1)
  ; 
  \end{circuitikz}
\end{center}

Design equations exist for the values of L and C given a desired phase
shift \(\phi\), namely:

$$ L = \frac{Z_0}{\omega sin(\phi)}, \qquad C =
\frac{sin(\phi)}{\omega Z_0 (1- cos(\phi))} $$

Given our design frequency of 2.45 GHz and our design meter \(\phi\)
